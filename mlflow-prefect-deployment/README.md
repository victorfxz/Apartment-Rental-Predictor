# README

This project includes a set of scripts for training, predicting, and testing machine learning models using MLflow and Prefect to predict apartment rental prices in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The following sections describe how to run each script and the purpose of each command.

## Setup

Before running any scripts, make sure you have installed all the required dependencies. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## MLflow Server

To start the MLflow server, run the following command:

```bash
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlruns --host 0.0.0.0
```

This command starts the MLflow server with a SQLite database as the backend store and sets the default artifact root to the `mlruns` directory. The server listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

## Training

To train the machine learning model, run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

This script trains the model and logs the metrics, parameters, and artifacts to the MLflow server.

## Prediction

To make predictions using the trained model, run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/predict.py
```

This script loads the trained model from the MLflow server and makes predictions on new data.

## Prefect Server

To start the Prefect server, run the following command:

```bash
prefect server start
```

This command starts the Prefect server, which is used to orchestrate and schedule the machine learning workflows.

## Prefect Flow

To run the Prefect flow, run the following command:

```bash
python prefect_flow.py
```

This script defines a Prefect flow that includes the training and prediction steps. The flow can be scheduled and monitored using the Prefect server.

## Testing Prediction

To test the prediction script, run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/test_predict.py
```
